#You will next create a plot that indicates very little 
  #correlation
  #The USArrests data frame has gruesome statistics on 
    #arrests for violent crimes, in arrests per 100,000 
    #residents, in each of the 50 US states in 1973. One of 
    #the variables in this data frame is Murder, which is 
    #the murder rate for each state. Another variable is 
    #UrbanPop, which is the percentage of the state's 
    #population that lives in an urban area. You can create 
    #a scatter plot of these two variables together with 
    #the linear regression line
usArrestsMurdScatt <- ggplot(USArrests, aes(x = UrbanPop,
                                            y = Murder))

                                                se = FALSE)
#output: scatter plot with line
  #data are very weakly correlated (as noted above)

#You now can make a plot that shows a negative correlation
  #The data frame mtcars has data from the 1974 Motor Trend 
  #magazine; this data covers 32 1973â€“74 models. One 
  #variable in this data frame is mpg, which is the car's 
  #mileage in miles per US Gallon of fuel. Another variable 
  #is disp, the engine displacement in cubic inches. You can 
  #create a scatter plot of these two variables with the 
  #linear regression line
mtcarsScatt <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg))
mtcarsScatt +  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = lm, 
                                          se = FALSE)
#output: negative correlated scatter plot
  #It also looks to be only moderately strong, but I have
  #no r value to confirm that

#Her output is the test statistics
  #Noteworthy: R-squared value is 0.576 which means that

    #accident damage costs - which also means that ~94%
    #of the variance is missing from this data

  #A car moving a 21 mph has a stopping distance of

#Note from lesson: Your regression model shows that it 
  #will take 159.36 feet to stop. However, you should be 
  #very hesitant to accept this number for the following 
  #reason: you have created the model using speeds 
  #between 4 and 25 miles per hour. There is no data to 
  #verify that your model will work well for speeds above 
  #25 miles per hour. In this case, you are using the 
  #model to extrapolate beyond the data, and 
  #extrapolation can be fraught with peril. In the case 
  #of the distance necessary to stop a car, this linear 
  #model may not be accurate at higher speeds.

#create a scatter plot with a best fit line
